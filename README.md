## General Information
This assignment is a programming assignment wherein you have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.


## Conclusions
Significant variables in prediction of count of the number of boom bikes are:
yr, temp, season (spring), mnth (july & september), weathersit (good & bad)
- Demand for boom bikes is expected to increase next year
- rainy season sees a decline in demand
- Demand increases when wheather is favorable for bike riders and declines in harsh weather situations.


Recommendations:
- More bikes to be kept available next year
- Measures should be taken to improve business in spring and unfavorable weather e.g. Offering Discounts during these periods
- Housekeeping can be scheduled during spring

## Technologies Used
Code is written in Python.
numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikitlearn and seaborn libraries are used.
